# QueenCity-Hackathon-2020

Upward mobility is a huge problem in Charlotte and I am here to provide some ideas on how to deal with it.

For dataset, they provided us with Charlotte Open Data Portal with over 150 datasets across 6 categories :
  - About Charlotte
  - Economic development
  - Housing and Neighborhood
  - Community Safety
  - Environment
  -Transportation

We ( my team of 4 ) searched dataset for couple of hours and we found that all the data that we have is Quantitative showing us that there is indeed the upward mobility but Why? We were very keen in finding out the WHY? 
 
Before that, we thought of using data and showing them some reason for the upward mobility and there were 3 important category responsible for upward mobility and that were - 
  - Education
  - Income
  - Poverty Rate
  
I used Tableau for comparing different aspects of these categories and while I was looking at them individually, I found that there were indeed similar patterns in these areas.

As you can see, lack of education ( lack of higher degree or diploma or similar kind ), unemployment rate and family poverty rate has similar pattern where center of charlotte has been affected badly by this. That means, if one has no diploma or higher education after high school that will lead to their unemployment and inturn leads to family poverty.

What we were not able to understand is that flow of money is huge in Charlotte and their are a lot of NGOs working for the betterment of these communities. So, what exactly went wrong?

For this, after long discussion we agreed that we need to understand the mind of Charlotte community and its people which ead us to the idea of getting a Qualitative dataset which helps us answer WHY?

## IDEA 

We thought of something like -
  - Having a Charlotte voice platform where people feel comfotable in sharing why they are not trying to move from low living standard     to higher one with the help of Government and NGO.
  - Having a tool to take CLT Voice platform, CLT Open Data Platform, NGO data and our Qualitative survey and combine them to use the       data set for future analysis.
  - Creating a Gamified Phone Application for younger generation which provides them educational support and ask surveys in between,       inreturn giving them coupons or gift cards after every level or two.

The process after gathering the dataset and combining them is -

I guess main idea for us in this Hackathon was getting to answer the WHY ( why some people and community, don't want to move from poverty to a better living given all the help) which was missing and that can be generated using our CLT Voice platform and the gamified phone application. After that, it's all about the magic of Data Science.
